# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/js-buy-sdk/blob/master/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/js-buy-sdk.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies:
```
npm install
```

Run the server:
```
npm start
```
Add some tests and make your change. Re-run the tests with:
```
npm run test
```

## Examples
See [here](https://github.com/Shopify/js-buy-sdk/blob/master/examples) for our examples.

## Documentation
If your change affects how people use the project (i.e. adding or
changing arguments to a function, adding a new function, changing the
return value, etc), please ensure the documentation is also updated to
reflect this. The docs live inside the `docs/` folder and are hosted
at `http://shopify.github.io/js-buy-sdk`.

To generate docs run the following:
```
npm run doc:build
```

To preview the built docs run:
```
npm run doc:serve
```

The documentation will then be visible at:
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/js-buy-sdk/`

If ever you'd like to view API docs for a specific version of the `js-buy-sdk` run the following command (replace `*VERSION NUMBER*` with a proper version such as `v0.3.2`):
```
npm run doc:build -- --references *VERSION NUMBER*
```

When serving you should now be able to view:
`http://127.0.0.1:4000/js-buy-sdk/api/v0.3.2/`
