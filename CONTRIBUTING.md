# How to contribute
We ❤️ pull requests. If you'd like to fix a bug, contribute a feature or
just correct a typo, please feel free to do so, as long as you follow
our [Code of Conduct](https://github.com/Shopify/js-buy-sdk/blob/main/CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md).

If you're thinking of adding a big new feature, consider opening an
issue first to discuss it to ensure it aligns to the direction of the
project (and potentially save yourself some time!).

## Getting Started
To start working on the codebase, first fork the repo, then clone it:
```
git clone git@github.com:your-username/js-buy-sdk.git
```
*Note: replace "your-username" with your Github handle*

Install the project's dependencies (make sure you first have [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com) installed):
```
yarn
```

To see documentation about npm scripts used in this project run:
```
yarn info
```

While developing the following command will run tests in browser at http://localhost:4200. It also watches the src/ and tests/ directory and rebuilds as needed:
```
yarn start
```

If you'd simply like to manually run tests do:
```
yarn test
```
