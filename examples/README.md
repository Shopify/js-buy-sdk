### JS Buy SDK Examples

To run the examples locally, you must first install the SDK's
dependencies and start a server to serve these files from:

```bash
npm install && npm run examples
```

Once it's running, open your browser to `http://localhost:4200/examples/<example-name>/` to view the example.
*eg: `/examples/cart` for the cart example*.

The examples works in Internet Explorer 9+, Safari 5.1+, iOS 6.1+,
Android 4.0+ and modern (current - 1) Chrome, Firefox and Opera.

Building the example requires Node.js 4.x+ and NPM 3.x+.
